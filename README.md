# Telex
Monome Teletype for the AE modular ecosystem

Ongoing project to bring the Monome Teletype module to AE Modular.

Current version requires external USB-C power to operate. Module is connected to the AE bus cable for grounding purposes only. Alternatively, the module could be housed separately and connected to the main AE rack by way of a patch cable between Telex ground and ground on the MASTER module. Either way, external power is necessary to avoid noise problems/high power draw from the large OLED display.

# Additional components required:

* general male and female pins/headers
* LEDs x 8
* 10k potentiometer
